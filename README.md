# Plan Generation and Execution Tools

Two-stage workflow for LLM-driven software development: plan creation followed by plan execution.

## Tools

### scripts/lisamarge.py
Creates implementation plans through iterative planner/reviewer cycles.

- **Input**: Problem statement
- **Output**: `PLAN_DRAFT_<name>.md` with LLM-executable steps ([ChangeSpecs](docs/CHANGESPECS.md))
- **Docs**: [LISAMARGE.md](docs/LISAMARGE.md)

```bash
./scripts/lisamarge.py \
  --kiro-cli-path /usr/local/bin/kiro-cli \
  --problem-statement "Add user authentication" \
  --plan-name auth_feature
```

### scripts/homerbart.py
Executes plans through worker/reviewer verification cycles.

- **Input**: `PLAN_DRAFT_<name>.md` from lisamarge
- **Output**: Completed implementation
- **Docs**: [HOMERBART.md](docs/HOMERBART.md)

```bash
./scripts/homerbart.py \
  --kiro-cli-path /usr/local/bin/kiro-cli \
  --plan-name auth_feature
```

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create plan
./scripts/lisamarge.py --kiro-cli-path kiro-cli --problem-statement "..." --plan-name feature

# 2. Execute plan
./scripts/homerbart.py --kiro-cli-path kiro-cli --plan-name feature
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- kiro-cli executable

**ChangeSpecs**: The plans generated by lisamarge decompose problems into ChangeSpecs - LLM-executable work units with four key qualities: Specificity, Context Constraint, Containment, and Stability. Each step in a plan is a ChangeSpec that can be reliably implemented by an LLM agent. See [CHANGESPECS.md](docs/CHANGESPECS.md) for details.
